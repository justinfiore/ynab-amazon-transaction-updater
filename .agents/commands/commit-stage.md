**DO NOT USE `git add -a`**

Use the `git` command line to:
1. Analyze the files on the git stage with `git diff --cached`
2. Create a commit using a commit message generated by "Call /commit-message" (the generated commit message should be in `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt`)
3. Delete `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt` if it exists
4. Push the commit to the remote with `git push origin HEAD`
6. Generate the PR Title and Body by analyzing all of the changes on the current branch (back to where it diverges from the `master` branch). 
  - The title should be informative and succinct
  - The body should be descriptive and explain the what and why of the PR. The body can include emojis and other icons if helpful.
7. Create a PR with `gh pr create --title '<title>' -F <bodyFile>`
8. Once the PR is created, extract the URL to the PR and open it with `open <prUrl>`
