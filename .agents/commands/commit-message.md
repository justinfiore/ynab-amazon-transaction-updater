Write a English commit message to the file `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt` (delete it first if it exists).

Only analyze the changes on the git stage `git diff --cached`

Use the following format for consistent and descriptive commit messages:

```
{prefix}: {subject}

{body}
```

Definitions of the parts

The first line should be the “subject” of the commit. 
It should give us a summary in one line.
- Written in Present Tense
- Written as Commands
- e.g., "BZ-4171: perf: Adds Pooled `RestTemplates` for the 3 different TAP-API Instances"

This is what the commit is DOING to the code in the present
Use Markdown if appropriate

**Body**
