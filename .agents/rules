# Building and running Tests

I have made your life easier by writing scripts for you to build, run unit tests and run integration tests.

# Cleaning the project

Clean the project with:
```
.windsurf/scripts/clean.sh
```

# Building the code

Build the code with:
```
.windsurf/scripts/build.sh
```

# Running the Unit Tests with Gradle
```
.windsurf/scripts/run-unit-tests.sh
```
The test output will be in `test-results/`

You can run specific tests with:
```
.windsurf/scripts/run-unit-tests.sh --tests <fully qualified test class or test method or wildcards>;
```
The test output will be in `test-results/`

# Running the Integration Tests with Gradle
```
.windsurf/scripts/run-integration-tests.sh
```
The test output will be in `test-results/`

You can run specific tests with:
```
.windsurf/scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --tests <fully qualified test class or test method or wildcards>
```

# Run all of the Tests with Gradle
```
.windsurf/scripts/run-tests.sh
```
The test output will be in `test-results/`
