# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for fetching Walmart order data and matching it with YNAB transactions. Walmart orders often result in multiple credit card charges for a single order, requiring intelligent association between YNAB transactions and Walmart orders. The system will update YNAB transaction memos with links to the corresponding Walmart order details page.

## Glossary

- **YNAB Transaction Updater**: The Groovy application that enhances YNAB transactions with retailer order details
- **Walmart Order**: A purchase made on Walmart.com that may result in one or more credit card charges
- **YNAB Transaction**: A financial transaction record in the YNAB (You Need A Budget) application
- **Transaction Matcher**: The component responsible for correlating YNAB transactions with retailer orders
- **Walmart Service**: The service component that fetches and processes Walmart order data
- **Order Link**: A URL pointing to the Walmart order details page on walmart.com
- **Headless Browser**: A browser automation tool (Playwright) that operates without a graphical interface
- **Multi-Transaction Order**: A Walmart order that generates multiple separate credit card charges

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a YNAB user who shops at Walmart, I want my Walmart transactions automatically matched with order details, so that I can track my purchases without manual memo updates

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the YNAB Transaction Updater processes transactions, THE Walmart Service SHALL fetch Walmart order data for the configured lookback period
2. WHEN Walmart order data is available, THE Transaction Matcher SHALL identify YNAB transactions that correspond to Walmart charges
3. WHEN a match is identified with sufficient confidence, THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL update the transaction memo with a Walmart order link
4. WHERE multiple YNAB transactions correspond to a single Walmart order, THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL associate all related transactions with the same order link
5. THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL track processed Walmart transactions to prevent duplicate updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Walmart integration settings, so that the system can authenticate and fetch order data via browser automation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration SHALL support Walmart integration settings including authentication credentials and browser timeout
2. THE Walmart Service SHALL use headless browser automation with Playwright for order retrieval
3. THE Configuration SHALL validate required Walmart settings at application startup
4. THE Configuration SHALL provide sensible defaults for Walmart-specific matching parameters
5. THE Configuration SHALL allow users to enable or disable Walmart integration independently of Amazon integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Walmart integration to follow the existing Amazon integration patterns, so that the codebase remains consistent and maintainable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Walmart Service SHALL implement the same service interface pattern as the Amazon Service
2. THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL process Walmart orders using the same workflow as Amazon orders
3. THE Walmart Service SHALL use model classes that follow the same structure as Amazon model classes
4. THE Walmart Service SHALL implement error handling consistent with existing service components
5. THE Walmart Service SHALL use the same logging patterns as other service components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a YNAB user, I want accurate matching between Walmart orders and YNAB transactions even when one order creates multiple charges, so that all related transactions are properly documented

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Walmart order generates multiple credit card charges, THE Transaction Matcher SHALL identify all corresponding YNAB transactions
2. THE Transaction Matcher SHALL use amount, date, and payee information to correlate transactions with Walmart orders
3. WHERE partial charges exist for a single order, THE Transaction Matcher SHALL sum transaction amounts to match the order total
4. THE Transaction Matcher SHALL apply confidence scoring to Walmart matches using configurable thresholds
5. WHERE confidence is below the threshold, THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL skip the transaction update

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a YNAB user, I want transaction memos to include direct links to Walmart order pages, so that I can quickly access order details and tracking information

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL format Walmart order links using the walmart.com order details URL pattern
2. THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL include the Walmart order number in the transaction memo
3. WHERE multiple transactions exist for one order, THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL use consistent memo formatting across all related transactions
4. THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL preserve existing memo content when appending Walmart order information
5. WHEN dry-run mode is enabled, THE YNAB Transaction Updater SHALL log proposed memo updates without modifying YNAB transactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling for Walmart integration, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system behavior

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Walmart Service SHALL log all order fetch attempts with timestamp and result status
2. WHEN authentication fails, THE Walmart Service SHALL log detailed error information and halt processing
3. WHEN network errors occur, THE Walmart Service SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to a configured maximum
4. THE Walmart Service SHALL log statistics including orders fetched, transactions matched, and updates performed
5. WHERE browser automation is used, THE Walmart Service SHALL log browser session lifecycle events

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for Walmart integration, so that I can confidently maintain and extend the functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Walmart Service SHALL have unit tests covering order fetching, parsing, and error scenarios
2. THE Transaction Matcher SHALL have unit tests covering multi-transaction order matching logic
3. THE Walmart integration SHALL have integration tests validating end-to-end order processing
4. THE test suite SHALL include test data representing typical Walmart order patterns
5. THE test suite SHALL validate behavior when Walmart orders have multiple associated transactions
