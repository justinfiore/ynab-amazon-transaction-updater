feat: implement Walmart transaction matching logic

Add comprehensive Walmart transaction matching capabilities to TransactionMatcher:

- Add Walmart payee detection with WALMART_PAYEE_NAMES constant
- Implement single-transaction matching for Walmart orders
- Implement multi-transaction matching for orders with multiple charges
- Add confidence scoring algorithms for both match types
- Support matching transactions to individual charge amounts
- Generate Walmart-specific memos with order links and product summaries
- Extend TransactionMatch model to support Walmart orders and multi-transaction matches

The matching logic follows the same pattern as Amazon matching but includes:
- Single transaction matching: 70% amount, 20% date, 10% payee
- Multi-transaction matching: 50% amount sum, 30% date proximity, 20% payee consistency
- Support for grouping transactions by date proximity (within 7 days)
- Combination generation to find transaction groups that sum to order totals

Comprehensive unit tests added covering:
- Single and multi-transaction matching scenarios
- Edge cases (date boundaries, amount mismatches, partial matches)
- Payee detection for various Walmart name formats
- Memo generation for both single and multi-charge orders
- Confidence scoring validation

Tasks completed: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
